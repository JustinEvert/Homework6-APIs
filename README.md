ANALYSIS OF WEATHERPY DATA - OBSERVABLE TRENDS

1. The City Latitude vs Maximum Temperatures scatter plot displays a clear pattern of temperatures rising at latitudes nearer to zero, while temperatures steadily decrease the further the city location is from the zero latitude. This pattern lends support to one of the more widely held assumptions about weather patterns as they relate to latitudinal proximity (higher temps) to, and distance from (lower temps), the equator. 

2. Another interesting observation across a pair of scatter plots which further reinforces the relationship between temperature and latitude, is that the majority of temperatures of 90F and above are located in the 20-40 degree latitude range, which conicides with the same latitudinal coordinates where the majority of 20% and lower humidity readings are located. Assuming that dryer climates and higher temperatures correlate (further investigation suggested) then there would seem to be a combination of weather factors which appear to be unique to this specific latitude range.

3. Also related to the City Latitude vs Humidity scatter plot there is a notable spike in humity levels within 5 degrees either side of the equator, with the lowest humidity reading in this geographical range being between 55-60% compared to humidity readings which fall as low as 20% by the 20 degrees from the equator range. A 35-40% drop in a 15 degree variance in distance from the equator should be considered significant.

4. While there appears to be no clear pattern in the relationship between latitude and cloudiness, the City Latitude vs Cloudiness chart displays a surpsing degree of uniformity related to equal/similar cloud readings across a wide range of latitudes. I suspect (again further investigation recommended) that maybe there exists a degree of uniformity in the way cloud data is collected and measured. For example, maybe there is a less specific/accurate means of collecting cloud data compared to measuring temperatures/humidity/wind speeds, which may be evident in a significant number of 'rounded' readings (e.g. 73 becomes 75 or 82 becomes 80) in the data. However, the possibility that this uniformity does reflect a relationship between humidity and some other factor should also be explored. For example, it would be interesting to compare humidity with longditute, instead of latitude, to see if there is a correlation between humidity and this alternative geographical factor/reading. 

5. There appears to be no clear/obvious correlation between city latitude and wind speeds
